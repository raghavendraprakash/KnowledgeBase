To assess and validate a user journey for an AI-First approach, it's crucial to understand that an "AI-First" strategy means embedding artificial intelligence at the core of a product's architecture from the outset, making intelligence, automation, and adaptability fundamental aspects of its functionality. This approach prioritizes AI as the foundational element, rethinking products and applying machine learning to solve user problems, rather than adding AI features later.

An AI-First user journey, therefore, is one where the interaction flow is inherently designed to leverage AI capabilities to learn and evolve, anticipate needs, personalize experiences at an unprecedented scale, and augment human capabilities, generating novel content or solutions beyond pre-programmed responses. It's about how AI guides the user from the start, providing enhanced personalization and efficiency.

We can use this template to assess and validate the user journey for an AI-First approach:
