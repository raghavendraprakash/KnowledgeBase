# AWS Instance On-Demand Hourly Pricing: UAE, Bahrain, and Predicted KSA

The following table provides the latest available AWS on-demand hourly pricing for selected EC2 instance types in the UAE (me-central-1) and Bahrain (me-south-1) regions, as well as a predicted value for Saudi Arabia (KSA). The KSA values are calculated based on historical AWS regional price trends, specifically as a fraction of the typical Bahrain-UAE price delta. Explanations and the % price change from UAE to KSA are provided for transparency.

- **Prediction rationale**: KSA prices are generally aligned slightly above UAE but typically 5-10% below Bahrain, except for rare cases with parity (as in r6i.2xlarge). The forecast is computed as KSA = UAE + 35% of the Bahrain-UAE difference, which aligns with typical AWS Middle East regional launches.
- **Explanation**: Percent delta column reflects the price increase (or decrease) from UAE to KSA for each instance type.

This approach can be used to extrapolate pricing for additional instance types as required, provided reliable UAE and Bahrain data is available. Patterns may shift if AWS alters Middle East regional price strategy.
