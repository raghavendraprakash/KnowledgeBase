To assess and validate a list of Persona-AI Features for an AI-First approach, it's essential to consider the core principles and best practices of AI-First product engineering. An AI-First approach means embedding artificial intelligence at the core of a product's architecture from the outset, making intelligence, automation, and adaptability fundamental aspects of its functionality, rather than adding AI features later [1, 2]. This approach aims to guide product design from the start, enabling new ways to solve complex problems, personalize user experiences, and build solutions that adapt over time [3, 4].

Here is a template you can use:
