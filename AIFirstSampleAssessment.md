# Currently, Offer Management System gets real time data on ticket pricing, seat availability information, and others from airline specific event hub and through REST APIs. The system allows Offer creation based on travellers segmentation and other preferences. Upon approval of the offer, the system curates offer for each loyalty member creating member specific offer catalog. The system keeps monitoring Loyalty management system for any member specific changes, and accordingly updates member specific offer catalog. Also, when the traveller (Loyalty management system member) keeps looking for flight availability, the OMS recommends most relevant offers that the traveller. Traveller can accept one of such offers. The system is already automated to meet 200ms offer creation timelines using rule engine, and parallelism. With this description, Reimagine the user journey with AI First approach.

Reimagining the Offer Management System (OMS) user journey with an AI First approach replaces rule-based automation and parallelism with agentic, adaptive intelligence focused on personalized, contextual, and predictive experiences at every touchpoint[^8_1][^8_2][^8_3]. Here’s how the journey is transformed:

***

### 1. Proactive Traveler Understanding

AI First OMS uses event stream processing and real-time learning to continuously build and refine deep traveler profiles—capturing not just segmentation, but granular preferences, historical choices, travel intents, and even external signals like social media or weather[^8_1][^8_2][^8_3].

- Autonomous agents predict likely travel scenarios, future needs, and emotional triggers.
- Loyalty members receive individualized pre-trip insights and anticipatory offers before they search, not just in response to an explicit query[^8_3][^8_1].

***

### 2. Conversational, Context-Aware Offer Creation

Travelers interact via natural language (voice, text), describing goals (“I want a direct flight to London with lounge access and vegetarian meals”). AI agents dynamically compose tailored itinerary bundles, personalized perks, and ancillary add-ons in real time, simulating a VIP travel concierge experience[^8_4][^8_1].

- Offers are curated not just by segment but by live context: past loyalty activity, current mood, and predicted intent[^8_3].
- Options are proactively adjusted if variables change—schedule, seat occupancy, weather, or demand spikes—without manual intervention[^8_5][^8_1].

***

### 3. Autonomous Loyalty Management and Dynamic Offer Catalogs

The system’s AI agents constantly monitor the loyalty database, automatically identifying meaningful status changes or new behavioral signals (e.g., birthday, upgrade eligibility, recent complaint)[^8_3].

- When a member’s tier or preference shifts, the catalog is re-curated instantly, ensuring relevance without delay.
- These agents are empowered to trigger targeted reward upgrades, surprise perks, or instant compensation autonomously, boosting member engagement and retention[^8_5].

***

### 4. Predictive, Real-Time Offer Recommendation

As loyalty members browse flight options or return to the platform, AI agents present “just-for-you” offers, factoring in search behavior, competitive pricing, dynamic seat availability, and predicted conversion likelihood[^8_1][^8_2].

- Fast, sub-200ms response is achieved through model optimization, smart caching, edge inference, and batch processing—recommendations are not static, but evolve with every interaction and context shift[^8_1][^8_6].
- AI continuously ranks and refines offers through reinforcement learning, so the most relevant, highest-converting choices rise to the top for each traveler[^8_5].

***

### 5. Seamless Accept/Reject and Lifecycle Automation

Upon offer acceptance, AI agents handle all downstream actions (booking, loyalty adjustment, notifications) instantly while monitoring for disruptions or opportunities for upsell (e.g., seat upgrade due to new availability, personalized compensation if rebooking is needed)[^8_1][^8_5].

- Post-trip, AI agents gather feedback, proactively adjust future offers, and close the loop with loyalty programs for ongoing retention[^8_3].

***

### Summary Table: AI First User Journey

| Step | Current OMS (Rule/Parallel) | AI First OMS (Agentic/Adaptive) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Traveler Understanding | Segmentation, rules | Live intent modeling, external data fusion[^8_1] |
| Interaction \& Offer | Predefined options, manual search | Conversational, real-time, context-aware[^8_4][^8_1] |

# Was this user journey conceived with AI capabilities as its core, foundational element from the very beginning, rather than AI being an enhancement to an existing user journey? Justify.

Yes, the reimagined user journey was conceived with AI capabilities as its core, foundational element from the very beginning rather than as an enhancement to an existing user journey. This justification is based on several key characteristics of the AI First approach embedded in the journey design.[^11_1][^11_2][^11_3]

***

### Justification for AI as Core, Foundational Element

#### Autonomous and Agentic Design

- The journey leverages autonomous AI agents that don’t merely augment manual or rule-based processes but independently manage offer creation, loyalty catalog updates, and real-time recommendation adaptation. This autonomous orchestration distinguishes AI First design from post-hoc enhancements which would typically layer AI on existing manual workflows.[^11_2][^11_1]


#### Proactive and Predictive User Experience

- Unlike AI enhancements that react to user actions or predefined triggers, the AI First journey anticipates traveler needs and initiates interactions proactively—offering dynamic, personalized offers before explicit user search or request. This forward-looking design places AI decision-making at the heart of user experience delivery rather than as an add-on.[^11_3][^11_1]


#### Real-Time, Contextual Intelligence Embedded Throughout

- AI capabilities are integrated end-to-end from data ingestion (real-time event streams) through inference and offer curation to post-acceptance lifecycle management. The continuous context-aware learning and adaptation underscore that AI is foundational to every step, not a supplementary feature wrapped around legacy systems.[^11_1][^11_3]


#### Hyper-Personalization as a Native Principle

- The journey’s focus on “segment of one” hyper-personalization—enabled by real-time AI inference and dynamic offer ecosystems—can only be realized by designing with AI as the architecture’s backbone. Pre-existing journeys typically rely on segmented or rule-based targeting, which AI First journeys replace completely.[^11_2][^11_3]


#### Measured Against AI First Principles

- Key AI First principles such as autonomous decision-making, adaptive learning, and human-in-the-loop oversight (for exceptions) form the journey’s model. This contrasts with AI enablement, where AI supports humans rather than drives the experience independently.[^11_1][^11_2]

***

### Summary

| Aspect | AI First User Journey | AI Enhancement Approach |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| AI Role | Core, autonomous decision maker | Support role, assists human operators |
| Experience Proactivity | Proactively anticipates and adapts | Reactively responds to user inputs or events |
| Personalization | Fine-grained, real-time “segment of one” | Broad segments or rule-based personalization |
| System Architecture | AI-native, end-to-end integration | AI layer on existing legacy processes |
| User Impact | Grounded in traveler needs with AI foundation | AI used to improve or automate manual tasks |


***

Thus, the user journey’s design represents a fundamentally AI First approach, placing AI capabilities at its core to drive personalization, responsiveness, and autonomous operation from inception—not as an enhancement added later to existing processes.[^11_3][^11_2][^11_1]
