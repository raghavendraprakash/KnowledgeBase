**List top 5 pain points customers are experiencing in their digital transformation with generative AI?**
Top 5 pain points customers face in their digital transformation with generative AI are:

1. **Integration with Legacy Systems**  
   Integrating generative AI tools with existing legacy software and systems is a major challenge, causing stress and complexity in implementation[1][3].

2. **Identifying Valuable Use Cases**  
   Pinpointing effective and valuable generative AI use cases that align with business strategy is difficult for many organizations[1].

3. **Incomplete and Static Customer Insights**  
   Traditional data collection methods fail to capture evolving customer behaviors, limiting personalization and customer experience improvements[6].

4. **High Content Creation Demands**  
   Producing consistent, high-quality content at scale remains time-consuming and resource-intensive without AI automation[5].

5. **Cost Control and ROI Uncertainty**  
   Managing costs and achieving clear return on investment from generative AI initiatives is a persistent concern for businesses[7].

These pain points highlight the complexity of adopting generative AI in digital transformation, spanning technical integration, strategic alignment, data challenges, operational efficiency, and financial justification[1][3][5][6][7].
