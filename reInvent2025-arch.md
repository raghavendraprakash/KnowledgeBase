Here are some relevant AWS re:Invent 2025 sessions related to Scalability, Performance, or Reliability based on available information:

1. Title: Scaling Serverless with Platform Engineering: A Blueprint for Success (CNS361)
   - Description: Explore how serverless architectures unlock the potential of AI agents in production systems, with patterns for automatic scaling and cost optimization. Learn event-driven and synchronous implementations and best practices to deploy and manage scalable AI agent systems.
   - Level: Not explicitly stated but appears to be intermediate to advanced.
   - Date and Time: Wednesday, December 3, 4:30 PM (PDT)
   - Target Audience: Developers, architects interested in serverless and AI systems.
   - Source: Referred on social media and session previews[1]

2. Title: Building resilient multi-Region applications with Capital One (ARC404)
   - Description: Learn to architect multi-Region applications for predictable recovery times and consistent operations using AWS Application Recovery Controller (ARC), Aurora DSQL, and DynamoDB Multi-Region Strong Consistency. Includes real-world implementation patterns and fault injection testing.
   - Level: Expert (Advanced)
   - Date and Time: Not explicitly stated
   - Target Audience: Architects, SREs, engineers focused on reliability and disaster recovery.

3. Title: Build a well-architected foundation for scaling generative AI and agentic apps (AIM310)
   - Description: Focuses on scaling AI applications from experimentation to enterprise scale with attention to model access, orchestration, state management, observability, and governance for scalable, performant, and reliable applications.
   - Level: Ranges from intermediate to advanced practical guidance
   - Date and Time: December 1, 10:00 AM (PDT)
   - Target Audience: AI application developers, architects
   - Source: AWS blog on Well-Architected sessions[3]

4. Additional topics are covered in the Compute, Storage, and Serverless & Containers tracks about performance tuning, cost optimization, and scalability strategies for high-throughput workloads.[4]
